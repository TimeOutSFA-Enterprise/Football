The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.

The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Spread: Seahawks -3.5

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",ravens,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team.

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",bills,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

Ebony Bird’s Chris Schisler believes the Ravens will be up to the task.",Late for Work 10/25: Midseason Grades & Superlatives,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/late-for-work-10-25-midseason-grades-superlatives

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Spread: Seahawks -3.5

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",browns,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2. QB LAMAR JACKSON, BALTIMORE RAVENS Is there any player that is more exciting to watch in the NFL right now than Lamar Jackson? 12. TE MARK ANDREWS, BALTIMORE RAVENS He has been their big-play threat, catching 11 passes of 15 or more yards and notching 449 receiving yards in total, which paces the team by over 100 yards. If the start to his second season as a pro is any indication, Andrews figures to be one of the top receiving threats at the tight end position for years to come. 24. RT ORLANDO BROWN JR, BALTIMORE RAVENS Among the 29 right tackles with 500 or more pass-blocking snaps since 2018, Brown’s pass-blocking grade of 76.2 ranks sixth.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",broncos,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team.

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",colts,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/
2019-10-25,"['practice', 'squad', 'nov', 'ravens', 'kamalu', 'teamer', 'sign', 'patriots', 'signed', 'texans', 'undefeated', 'ufomba']",jaguars,"Boston Globe, the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

His run-blocking grade is what has held his overall grade down a bit, and it’s the reason he ranks 14th among qualifying right tackles in 2019.","Ravens News 10/25: QB Index, playoff projections and more",https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2019/10/25/20929606/ravens-news-10-25-qb-index-playoff-projections-lamar-jackson-mark-andrews-orlando-brown-richards
2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",jaguars,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him.

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

2019-10-25,"['season', 'deadline', 'ravens', 'defensive', 'breer', 'trade', 'teams', 'oct', 'nfl', 'need', 'rush', 'possibilities', 'bowl', 'win', 'farrar', 'doug', 'pass']",chargers,"After a convincing 30-16 win against the Seattle Seahawks Oct. 20, the Baltimore Ravens are now 5-2 headed into the bye week with the New England Patriots coming to town for ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.







With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",chargers,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/
2019-10-25,"['practice', 'squad', 'nov', 'ravens', 'kamalu', 'teamer', 'sign', 'patriots', 'signed', 'texans', 'undefeated', 'ufomba']",dolphins,"Boston Globe, the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Ufomba Kamalu has been signed by Baltimore off the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",jets,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Ufomba Kamalu has been signed by Baltimore off the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line. Kamalu is the second former Patriots player to join Baltimore’s roster this week. Former Patriots safety Jordan Richards was signed Thursday by the Ravens.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.

The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Spread: Seahawks -3.5

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",steelers,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",titans,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line. Kamalu is the second former Patriots player to join Baltimore’s roster this week. Former Patriots safety Jordan Richards was signed Thursday by the Ravens. Richards replaced former Ravens cornerback and special teams standout Justin Bethel, who signed with the Patriots after Baltimore released him Tuesday.",Ravens Sign Former Patriots Defensive Lineman,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-sign-former-patriots-defensive-lineman

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

Ebony Bird’s Chris Schisler believes the Ravens will be up to the task.",Late for Work 10/25: Midseason Grades & Superlatives,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/late-for-work-10-25-midseason-grades-superlatives

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

2019-10-25,"['season', 'deadline', 'ravens', 'defensive', 'breer', 'trade', 'teams', 'oct', 'nfl', 'need', 'rush', 'possibilities', 'bowl', 'win', 'farrar', 'doug', 'pass']",falcons,"After a convincing 30-16 win against the Seattle Seahawks Oct. 20, the Baltimore Ravens are now 5-2 headed into the bye week with the New England Patriots coming to town for ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.







With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Spread: Seahawks -3.5

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",falcons,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/
2019-10-25,"['practice', 'squad', 'nov', 'ravens', 'kamalu', 'teamer', 'sign', 'patriots', 'signed', 'texans', 'undefeated', 'ufomba']",panthers,"Boston Globe, the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",panthers,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team.

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",cowboys,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/
2019-10-25,"['practice', 'squad', 'nov', 'ravens', 'kamalu', 'teamer', 'sign', 'patriots', 'signed', 'texans', 'undefeated', 'ufomba']",lions,"Boston Globe, the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

If the start to his second season as a pro is any indication, Andrews figures to be one of the top receiving threats at the tight end position for years to come. 24. RT ORLANDO BROWN JR, BALTIMORE RAVENS Among the 29 right tackles with 500 or more pass-blocking snaps since 2018, Brown’s pass-blocking grade of 76.2 ranks sixth. His run-blocking grade is what has held his overall grade down a bit, and it’s the reason he ranks 14th among qualifying right tackles in 2019.","Ravens News 10/25: QB Index, playoff projections and more",https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2019/10/25/20929606/ravens-news-10-25-qb-index-playoff-projections-lamar-jackson-mark-andrews-orlando-brown-richards
2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",lions,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

Ebony Bird’s Chris Schisler believes the Ravens will be up to the task.",Late for Work 10/25: Midseason Grades & Superlatives,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/late-for-work-10-25-midseason-grades-superlatives

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row.

He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team.

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",rams,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.",AFC North Week 8 preview: Ravens can still win on their bye,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/afc-north-week-8-preview-ravens-can-still-win-on-their-bye/

Ufomba Kamalu has been signed by Baltimore off the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",giants,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.",AFC North Week 8 preview: Ravens can still win on their bye,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/afc-north-week-8-preview-ravens-can-still-win-on-their-bye/

Ufomba Kamalu has been signed by Baltimore off the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line. Kamalu is the second former Patriots player to join Baltimore’s roster this week. Former Patriots safety Jordan Richards was signed Thursday by the Ravens.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.

The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.",AFC North Week 8 preview: Ravens can still win on their bye,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/afc-north-week-8-preview-ravens-can-still-win-on-their-bye/

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Seattle at Atlanta

Kickoff: Sunday, Oct. 27 at 1 p.m. ET

Spread: Seahawks -3.5

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",niners,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Ufomba Kamalu has been signed by Baltimore off the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The 6-foot-6, 300-pound Kamalu has played in 15 regular season games and registered 12 tackles and three sacks. He was an undrafted free agent from Miami in 2016 who has played with both the Patriots and Houston Texans. He was waived by the Patriots during final roster cuts in September before being signed to the practice squad.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",seahawks,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""

— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).",Ravens currently have 25th pick in 2020 NFL draft after Week 7,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/2020-nfl-draft-order-ravens-hold-no-25-pick-after-week-7/

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Kamalu will have an opportunity to help Baltimore’s interior pass rush, joining Jihad Ward and Zach Sieler as recent additions to the 53-man roster on the defensive line. Kamalu is the second former Patriots player to join Baltimore’s roster this week. Former Patriots safety Jordan Richards was signed Thursday by the Ravens. Richards replaced former Ravens cornerback and special teams standout Justin Bethel, who signed with the Patriots after Baltimore released him Tuesday.",Ravens Sign Former Patriots Defensive Lineman,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-sign-former-patriots-defensive-lineman

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

Ebony Bird’s Chris Schisler believes the Ravens will be up to the task.",Late for Work 10/25: Midseason Grades & Superlatives,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/late-for-work-10-25-midseason-grades-superlatives

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Ronnie Stanley is on another level protecting his QB! 💪 pic.twitter.com/rYJ7nitYHp — PFF (@PFF) October 24, 2019

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.

The only guaranteed week of stress free football that we have as Ravens fans. For the ones who read this that aren’t Ravens fans, your time is coming, or already has.

Regardless of stress level, this article aims to make you chuckle, shake your head, or maybe just roll your eyes. This is the Chicken Box, an amalgamation of random NFL-related thoughts from around the league over the past week. Let’s get into it.

Josh Gordon is back on the market (soon).

The long-troubled – and talented – wideout suffered an injury against the Giants, re-aggravating his knee. As a result, the undefeated New England Patriots placed him on injured reserve with the intention of waiving him later. This will make Gordon eligible to get healthy and play for another team this season – including signing with a contender that could use him for a late-season push.

The Patriots got good production out of Gordon. In 17 games, he caught 60 passes for 1,007 yards (16.7YPR average) as well as four touchdowns. If a team can sign him to a veteran minimum (or at least an inexpensive contract) they should be more than happy with about 60 yards per game with the possibility of a score. While he isn’t nearly as good as he used to be, he’s still a threat in the passing game. I mean, he’s gotta be a better option than Antonio Brown, right?

Let’s not act like…

The Patriots or 49ers have had challenging schedules.

The 49ers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL. The second easiest? That’s right. The other undefeated team, up there in New England. With that being said, maybe we take their undefeated records with a grain of salt – regardless of the fact that you can only play who’s on your schedule. The 49ers scored nine whole points against the Washington Redskins, who aren’t exactly world-beaters. The Patriots struggled against the Bills.

An interesting side note – take a look at the Bills’ schedule this season so far. At 5-1 (with that loss being the aforementioned game against the Patriots), you could very easily throw them into that pretender-contender category so far. The same category that the Baltimore Ravens were in before they absolutely throttled the Seattle Seahawks in Week 7.

The Chargers should’ve traded Melvin Gordon.

They ignored some fairly decent offers for the once-stud running back, during his holdout. Then he came back, and everybody expected him to return to form.

Instead, over the last three games, he has a 2.3 YPC average. He’s carried the ball 36 times, for a putrid 81 yards and no touchdowns. The Chargers are a surprising 2-5, losing the last three games to absolutely amazing teams such as the Titans, Steelers, and Broncos. For those keeping score at home, those are all teams with losing records.

Gordon isn’t making a difference to this team, and now the Chargers have shown that he isn’t the same player that he used to be, and effectively killed their chances at any kind of worthy draft capital.

How very Chargers of them.

As an added note, Gordon shouldn’t be playing for himself, either. He’s damaging his free agency value with every bad game he has.

Injuries have deprived us of a great matchup.

I’m speaking of course, of the possibility of Patrick Mahomes versus Aaron Rodgers.

Most of you will remember that I spoke on the Mahomes injury in my last article, and how Mahomes shouldn’t miss too much time. But he will miss this game at least, along with about half of the Chiefs starters, which is disappointing to say the least.

The Chiefs were the darling of the preseason and early season, until they dropped two straight, and then Mahomes went out with the injury. The Packers have been on fire, with Rodgers playing some of the best football of his career. Both teams have improved defenses, which used to be their weaknesses. So it was shaping up to be an absolute beauty fo a game, and now we get a matchup with a lopsided advantage.

I’m not really happy about that. I don’t think many other football fans are either.

Russell Street Report The Coordinators Checking in on the Red Zone Offense

The bye week is the perfect time to do some check-ins on some of the nitty gritty details of the Ravens offense.

One of the more common complaints I’m noticing in the twittersphere is that the Ravens are struggling in the red zone. As always, that means it’s time for The Coordinators to investigate the data and tendencies to try and identify some of the issues and break any myths that may exist.

Before jumping into it, I want to take the time to acknowledge Josh (@yoshi2052) who is the data guy for The Coordinators. If you need any data points pulled, just tweet at him and he’ll likely have it available. If it isn’t readily available, he’ll find it for you.

The RZ Offense through 7 weeks

The red zone offense has certainly suffered from some issues, but relative to the rest of the league, it hasn’t been as doom and gloom as some think. Let’s look at the numbers.

The Ravens have had 70 offensive drives through seven weeks. Of those 70 drives, 26 have resulted in a red zone scoring attempt (37%).

This is significant because the Ravens are currently 1st in the NFL in 2 categories:

— Yards per drive (42.51)

— Points per drive (2.86)

The scoring success in the red zone is a big part of that. Of those 26 red zone drives, 24 have resulted in points.

The only two unsuccessful attempts in the red zone came against the Dolphins and Cardinals in both cases, the Ravens kneeled out the clock in the red zone to end the game. Given the context of those drives, we’ll remove those, as the Ravens intentionally did not attempt to score.

To break it down:

It should be noted that during one of the RZ trips in the Cardinals game, the Ravens entered red zone territory on 3rd down before kicking a FG. Play sequence:

— 3rd & 11 at ARI 23 (14:54 – 2nd) (Shotgun) L. Jackson pass short middle to M. Andrews to ARZ 15 for 8 yards

— 4th & 3 at ARI 15 (14:07 – 2nd) Justin Tucker 33 Yard Field Goal

It counts in the official percentages, but it is important to distinguish that it wasn’t necessarily a Red Zone opportunity.

Ranking Against the Rest of the League

As we saw above, the Ravens rank in the top of the league in quite a few categories. In addition to yards and points per drive, the Ravens are currently the NFL’s best offense in yards per game and rush yards per game.

Let’s look at the red zone rankings.

In terms of coming away with points in the red zone, obviously the Ravens are top of the league. As mentioned, those two game-ending drives should be removed because they were running out the clock, as opposed to trying to score. With that said, the Ravens have scored on 100% of red zone drives. This speaks to their ability to protect the ball, as they still haven’t had a turnover in the red zone.

When looking at coming away from a red zone drive with a touchdown, the Ravens are currently ranked 15th in the NFL at 57%. The Buffalo Bills lead the league, scoring a touchdown in the red zone on 69% of their attempts.

What’s interesting though is that the Ravens are 4th in the NFL with 4.0 red zone scoring attempts per game. Compare that to the Bills, who are ranked 25th with 2.7 attempts per game.

Sample bias does play a role. With more attempts, naturally there are more possibilities of a failed attempt, or settling for a field goal. Let’s compare to the rest of the offenses that lead the league in RZ attempts per game:

— San Francisco – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 38% touchdown rate (29th)

— New England – 4.3 attempts per game (1st), 53% touchdown rate (19th)

— LA Rams – 4.1 attempts per game (2nd), 62% touchdown rate (11th)

— Seattle – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 64% touchdown rate (6th)

— Baltimore – 4.0 attempts per game (3rd), 57% touchdown rate (15th)

This is where we see some interesting data. The teams with the highest attempts per game aren’t in the top of the league in touchdown rate, and the Ravens fit right in there with NE and LAR. The real cream of the crop here are the Seattle Seahawks – coincidentally, the Ravens only allowed a touchdown on one of their four red zone drives last Sunday, so that’s great news for the red zone defense.

It’s important to do these league-wide comparisons, as sometimes fans can get stuck where we only watch the Ravens play and don’t have the full context. If you’re frustrated with the Ravens red zone offense, just imagine being a 49ers fan!

Lamar Jackson in the Red Zone

We’ll get into some of the play-calling issues in the red zone, but first we wanted to take a look at Lamar Jackson’s passing numbers in the red zone.

Overall this year: 136/215 (63.3%), 11 TD, 5 INT

In the RZ this year: 13/28 (46.4%), 6 TD, 0 INT

[Related: Midseason Report Card]

Lamar has protected the ball well this year, as evidenced by having 0 turnovers in the red zone, but the passing offense has not operated well enough in the red zone.

That said, Lamar can do things like this…

So..give and take.

Issues in the Red Zone

A few weeks ago the Ravens got into some of the issues with the passing offense following a win against the Steelers.

Some of the issues to identify with their red zone offense are similar.

The play-calling at times has left a lot to be desired. For example, the Ravens haven’t done a good enough job using some of the length on their roster, such as Miles Boykin. One thing I’d like to see the Ravens try is a back shoulder fade to Boykin. With Lamar’s improved accuracy, and Boykin’s short area quickness and length, it should be a good match to get off the line quickly and get enough room. Additionally, splitting Mark Andrews out on the boundary could result in a LB or S matched up on him to again create a mismatch where Andrews can use his size.

Let’s look at the red zone play calling.

The overall play-calling for the Ravens this year has been one of balance. A few outliers exist, such as the KC and CLE games where they were playing from behind, which naturally leads to more passes, but overall it’s been a pretty balanced approach.

That hasn’t been the case in the red zone, where the rush offense has been the go-to. More balance, and more shots into the end zone, may go a long way to upping that TD percentage.

That said, the Ravens have suffered from pressure during red zone passing attempts. It isn’t necessarily bad offensive line play; it’s seemed more like timely blitzes, likely teams preparing for the run, and the ball not getting out quick enough leading to throwaways or bad attempts.

Some nicely schemed crossing routes and deep ball fades are two suggestions that the RSR Coordinators propose. Of Lamar’s 16 red zone completions, six of them have been for touchdowns, so there’s a big reason to keep chucking that ball into the end zone. Lamar has also done a great job of putting the ball in a position where only his guys can get it.

As always, The Coordinators will be tracking these trends as the season goes on, but this is a bye week pulse check that indicates that Ravens are doing well in the red zone with room for improvement.",Baltimore Ravens: Do the Ravens Have a Red Zone Problem?,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/the-coordinators/checking-in-on-the-red-zone-offense/

Russell Street Report Guest Blog Lazy Journalists Preach Sustainability

Putting the Sustainability Argument to Bed

After his signature win in Seattle vs fellow MVP candidate Russell Wilson, like every other Ravens fan, I was excited to hear what the national media would have to say about Lamar Jackson. While the vast majority are singing the praises of the 22-year-old phenom, there still exists a group of skeptics who question the “sustainability” of Jackson and feel his playing style will lead him to injury. After 14 starts, this “analysis” has become outdated and quite frankly, it’s lazy.

Jackson is no more an injury risk than any other signal caller in the NFL for a multitude of reasons:

His Spotless Injury History. Jackson has been available for all 61 games of his college and professional career. What makes this stat remarkable is his historic level of usage during that span. He’s tallied 885 rushing attempts and 1441 passing attempts in college and pro combined. He missed a couple of plays at the end of the Ravens game in Kansas City last December but other than that, you would have to go back to a game vs Wake Forest in October of 2015 during his freshman season at Louisville, to find an instance where he was unable to finish a game due to injury (ankle sprain).

Oh, he played the following week.

Not all athletes are created equal. Some are more injury prone than others due to genetic factors. Joint mobility/stability, muscle pliability, and bone density are just a few of many variables that would make one athlete more susceptible to injury than another. While it’s hard to say for sure where Jackson stands in these areas, given his non-existent injury history, it’s safe to say his frame can withstand the rigors of his playing style. Just another example of how Jackson won the genetic lottery.

[Related Article: More Love For LJ8]

While I’ve heard frequent comparisons made to RG3 when predicting Jackson’s demise, few recall that he came into the league with a repaired ACL from a tear he sustained during his sophomore season at Baylor. Then during his rookie year, he sprained his LCL on a nasty hit from Haloti Ngata in week 14 and played 4 more snaps AFTER the hit! He only sat out 1 game before Shanahan and Co. allowed him to limp into a playoff game vs Seattle where he shredded his ACL and LCL on the same knee trying to pick up a fumble.

This comparison is ridiculous. RG3 wasn’t as gifted at making people miss (do you see Ngata in his prime catching Jackson?) with a checkered injury history who was wildly mismanaged by a circus of an organization. Stop it.

Jackson avoids contact. Another frequently made comparison is to Cam Newton. The argument is that Jackson won’t be able to absorb the same level of contact as Newton because his frame isn’t as big.

No shit. If you’ve seen a Panthers game in the last decade, you’ve seen how they employ Newton: as a battering ram. Newton repeatedly carrying the ball up the gut into a sea of 300 pounders is a far cry from Jackson scampering past defensive backs and finding a safe place to fall down. Once again, lazy analysis.

Recent history says the pocket is more dangerous than the open field. Looking at the current rash of injuries at the quarterback position, almost all of them have occurred during pass attempts. Nick Foles, Matt Ryan, Mason Rudolph, Drew Brees, and Trevor Siemian won’t be suiting up this week because of hits they took dropping back and throwing the ball.

The only QB hurt while running this season was Patrick Mahomes vs the Broncos, and that was a routine QB sneak. While I’m referencing that game, did you see the cringe worthy hits taken by Joe Flacco? I counted three hits he took that were all more violent than any one hit Jackson has taken in his entire career.

Who is more likely to get injured? A sitting duck getting blasted by 250-300 pound pass rushers while they are looking down field or arguably the NFL’s most gifted runner gliding through cornerbacks on his way to the sidelines and another first down?

Look, Jackson could be injured at any moment, it’s a brutal sport. Yet my argument is the same and could be said for any player in the league.

Instead of questioning the sustainability, how long it’s going to last or predicting its end, a more interesting analysis would be how to stop it.

Russell Street Report Report Card Midterm Grades are In

Are you feeling the effects of the bye week blues? Yeah, me too, but that’s okay because Dr. Jackson is going to take this opportunity to do a check up on the Ravens performance up to the bye week.

Offense

Overall: B+

If I had told you prior to the season that the Ravens offense would rank:

— 2nd in total offense (yards per game)

— 1st in rushing offense (by 30 yards per game over second place)

— 2nd in points per game

You’d probably be a little shocked. To be fair, you’d buy the rushing offense because this was a well-known strength going into the season, but Lamar Jackson’s passing has improved and has strengthened the offenseinto a more complete unit.

Let’s break it down.

Jackson on Jackson: A-

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm improved? Yes.

Is Lamar Jackson’s arm a finished product? No.

Lamar is a 22-year-old sophomore who still hasn’t completed a full season (he now has 15 starts in the NFL). His passing has been average thus far, but what he has done with his legs is truly what makes him special. If he can continue to be an average passer this year, while using his legs the way he has, he’s going to become even more dangerous.

It seems every week we hear about a new record that Jackson has set. He is currently 6th in the NFL in rushing yards and has a whopping 6.9 yards per carry. What’s even crazier about his average is when you adjust his rushing attempts to take out QB kneels, which shouldn’t count as a rushing attempt (running backs don’t have those, folks) it’s even more impressive.

Lamar overall:

83 for 576 (6.94)

Take away 10 kneels for -10:

73 for 586 (8.03). He also gets a 0 yard carry for the snap that hit Andrews:

72 for 586 (8.14) 23 for 255 (11.09) [scrambles]

49 for 331 (6.76) [designed runs] — KingMoose (@Yoshi2052) October 23, 2019

Not impressed? Just consider this gem:

If that’s not enough for you out of LJ at this point, I’m not sure what to tell you. We just witnessed Jackson completely take over the game in a win against the Seattle Seahawks in their own barn and out-Russell-Wilson Russell Wilson himself, so yeah I’d say that’s worthy of an A- grade.

Running back: A-

I’ve been asking for the three-headed monster attack since the Ravens signed Mark Ingram and drafted Justice Hill. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized, but this group has worked together to provide a trio of complementary skillsets. Ingram brings the all-around #1 RB skillset, Gus Edwards adds the smash-that-hole mentality, and Hill brings the wiggle.

Jackson has been a huge catalyst of this rushing attack, but these three deserve a ton of credit for running hard and finding the end zone (Mark Ingram is tied for second in the league for most rushing TDs). Expect a lot more strong rushing games after the bye.

Wide Receiver: C+

The Ravens are certainly missing the high flying skillset of Marquise ‘Hollywood’ Brown. Brown came out of the gates guns blazing, but unfortunately is now nursing an injury. Luckily, John Harbaugh indicated that Brown should return after the bye against the New England Patriots.

Brown’s effectiveness was limited in the weeks before his injury and the WR targets in general have been quite low, which leads to the average grade. It’s not necessarily on the wide receivers, as they haven’t had a lot of opportunities. Luckily we’ve seen flashes from rookies Brown and Miles Boykin, as well as some veteran contributions from Willie Snead and Seth Roberts.

A key to getting this offensive passing attack really going is going to be using these weapons at WR and getting them more involved in the passing attack, particularly down the field.

Tight End: A

Make no mistake, the Ravens boast the best trio of TEs in the league. Similar to the running backs, there’s a complementary skillset that allows all three to be in the game at any given time. The athleticism of Mark Andrews and Hayden Hurst allow them to be split out in the slot, which has allowed the Ravens to use 12 personnel in empty backfields to spread out the defense and create mismatches. The blocking of Nick Boyle has been outstanding and he basically acts as a 6th offensive lineman who can get out in the flats and make catches.

It doesn’t hurt that there’s many weeks where Andrews is the Ravens best offensive skill player. The drops against the Seahawks are the outlier and he’s still an absolute animal.

Offensive Line: B

The offensive tackle combination of Ronnie Stanley and Orlando Brown Jr. has evolved into one of the better ones in the NFL. Stanley is playing at an elite level for a LT, and despite a rough start to the season, Brown Jr. has rebounded with some stellar performances.

Bradley Bozeman and Matt Skura continue to be up and down, but they’re far from being a liability in the interior. Marshal Yanda continues to prove that age is just a number with elite play. If Bozeman and Skura can continue average starter-level play, which will include some bumps here and there, the Ravens will continue to produce with a strong offensive line.

This is a top 10 offensive line in the NFL, mostly because of the high level of play from Stanley, Brown and Yanda.

Defense

Overall: B-

This is a tough grade. If it was grading the start of the season it’d be in the low C to D range. However, the defense has rebounded with some stability in the secondary provided by Chuck Clark and the additions of L.J. Fort and Josh Bynes to the linebacker group.

Overall though, I have to lean towards recent performances, as I believe that is what we should expect coming out of the bye, and that’s what bumps the grade up to a B-.

Defensive Line: B-

The combination of Brandon Williams and Michael Pierce are major reasons why the Ravens feature the 3rd best rushing defense (based on yards per game). When Williams is out it’s very noticeable and he has justified his value as of late. The Ravens are going to have a very hard time holding onto Pierce this offseason.

The pass rush continues to be the major question mark of this defense and is the reason for the lower grade, relative to the strong run defense. Many Raven fans are waiting for a trade for a pass rusher, and while I’d love to see one added, I’m not sure a difference-maker is in the cards as the asking price for former Maryland Terrapin, Yannick Ngakoue, is likely too high. The Ravens are relying on the blitz again this year to get pressure.

The good news? The Ravens used that approach last year and boasted the #1 defense in the NFL. With the stability in the secondary, a little more juice from Matt Judon, Tyus Bowser and Jaylon Ferguson could lead to some better pass rushing results.

Linebackers: B

Again, this is a tough grade with the transition at the inside linebacker position. Patrick Onwuasor has been hurt, Kenny Young was traded and Chris Board is riding the pine. This would normally be a scary situation, but the additions of Fort and Bynes have been game changers for the middle of the field.

Fort and Bynes have shown significantly better awareness to cover their gaps in the run game, and while they aren’t the greatest athletes, they do show a better understanding of where they need to be in coverage. Getting Peanut back, and allowing him to move back to WILL LB, will only help this group, as he can be free to cover the flats and rush the quarterback, which he excelled at last year. Sunny days ahead for this group, and again the grade is bumped because of how significant the contributions of the recent additions have been.

Defensive Backs: B-

Marcus Peters made his debut with an absolute bang by allowing one catch for eight yards and taking Russell Wilson’s first pick of the year to the house. Marlon Humphrey has solidified himself as one of the top corners in the entire NFL. Combine that addition with the fact that Jimmy Smith should be returning soon and there’s plenty of reasons to be excited.

It hasn’t been easy though. The DB group was a strength going into the season, but the Smith injury and the injury to Tavon Young caused a very rough start to the season. Tony Jefferson was also lost for the season, but to be honest Chuck Clark has been an upgrade and looks a lot better in coverage than Jefferson did.

Whether that’s because the Ravens sorted out their communication or because Clark fits the role better, it’s hard to say, but what matters is this group is starting to click.

Special Teams – A

Justin Tucker is great.

Sam Koch is great.

The Ravens did allow the Bengals to score a kick-off return for a touchdown though, so that takes the + off the A for this grade.

MVP

This won’t surprise you, but it has to be Lamar Jackson. He put the team on his back against the Seahawks, which may be one of the biggest regular season wins in the John Harbaugh era. He’s a gamer, who will continue to get better. The Ravens are in good hands.

The General Manager: A+

Eric DeCosta has been a great story of this Ravens season. In his first offseason as GM he put together a very strong roster. They hit some bumps in the road, and EDC has adjusted accordingly with the key additions of Peters, Fort and Bynes.

Add to it that he got a 5th round pick for a kicker who isn’t in the league anymore, and flipped unused assets in Alex Lewis (though he is now playing for the Jets) and Jermaine Eluemunor, it’s just gravy. Again, the Ravens are in good hands with EDC at the helm.

And look at this…was EDC up in some box staying warm on Sunday in Seattle? Hell no! He was on the field with his team!

(0:41 mark here)

How can you not love this guy?

The Coaching: B+

John Harbaugh faced some early criticism for his approach in the Kansas City game. He was then praised for his aggressiveness against the Seahawks last week. He also provided the sound bite of the year with his interaction with Lamar Jackson during the 4th and 2 decision.

Despite the criticism, Harbaugh continues to field competitive football teams and bounced back from the Cleveland Browns loss with an absolute statement against the Seahawks.

Greg Roman has really catered the offense to the strengths of the team by focusing on running the ball and implementing a strong west coast offense passing attack. When the Ravens stay true to who they are, they’ve done very well on offense and the scheme is a large reason why.

Don ‘Wink’ Martindale has rebounded very well. His scheme appears similar to last year, but it really required certain skillsets to make it work. With stability in the second and third level, it looks like the Ravens are back there.",Baltimore Ravens: Report Card,https://russellstreetreport.com/2019/10/25/report-card/midterm-grades-are-in/

The Ravens The Ravens are signing defensive end Ufomba Kamalu off the New England Patriots' practice squad, as first reported by The , the second former Patriots player the Ravens are adding in advance of their game against the undefeated AFC frontrunners Nov. 3. The Ravens announced the move the afternoon of Oct. 25.





The Ravens have an open roster spot after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was placed on injured reserve with a triceps injury. On Oct. 24, the Ravens signed safety and special teamer Jordan Richards , who had been cut by the Patriots after they signed former Ravens special teamer Justin Bethel.





The Ravens (5-2) host the Patriots (7-0) at M&T Bank Stadium on ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.





Kamalu, who turns 27 next week, was originally signed by the Houston Texans as an undrafted rookie out of Miami in 2016. He spent parts of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with the Texans, appearing in 13 games, with three starts, and totaled 11 tackles and three sacks.





He was on the Arizona Cardinals' practice squad in 2018 before joining the Patriots later that year, first on the practice squad and then later promoted to the 53-man roster. Kamalu finished the year with one tackle in two games. He was cut by the Patriots at the end of training camp this summer and then re-signed to the practice squad.





Kamalu (6-foot-6, 295 pounds) is the latest addition to a defense that has been reinventing itself on the fly this season. Inside linebackers Josh Bynes and L.J. Fort were signed off the street and have been starters the past two weeks, the Ravens traded for cornerback Marcus Peters, and like Kamalu, Jihad Ward was signed as a free agent to bolster the defensive line.

With no Ravens game on Sunday, there will be plenty of time for raking leaves and cleaning out the gutters ... OK, who are we kidding? You plan to watch football, just not Ravens football. In that case, here are three other games that can keep you busy from 1 p.m. to midnight. (Don't worry, the leaves will still be there ...):





Philadelphia Eagles (3-4) at Buffalo Bills (5-1), 1 p.m.





Are the Bills for real? They look to be on their way to their second playoff berth since 2000 -- the first came after the Bengals KO'd the Ravens on New Year's Eve two years ago -- behind second-year quarterback Josh Allen and a defense that ranks No. 3 overall and No. 3 in scoring, allowing 15.2 points a game. The Ravens visit Buffalo Dec. 8.





The Eagles are very much alive in the underwhelming NFC East, a game behind front-running Dallas (4-3) in what appears to be a two-horse race.





Cleveland Browns (2-4) at New England Patriots (7-0), 4:25 p.m.





If the Patriots win, the Browns would fall three games behind the Ravens in the AFC North race. Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield has been practicing fully this week after injuring his hip Oct. 13, so he should be good to go against a defense that ranks No. 1 overall and No. 2 against the pass and has allowed 48 points all season. Against the Patriots, opposing quarterbacks have thrown 18 interceptions and one touchdown pass.





Tom Brady (11 TDs, four interceptions), running back Sony Michel and wide receiver Julian Edelman lead a familiar Patriots offense, but head coach Bill Belichick is always tweaking. The Antonio Brown era in New England proved to be short-lived, but this week, the Patriots added wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, whom they acquired from the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a second-round draft pick.





Green Bay Packers (6-1) at Kansas City Chiefs (5-2), Sunday, 8:20 p.m.





The ""Sunday Night Football"" game may have lost some luster with Chiefs quarterback and reigning league Most Valuable Player Patrick Mahomes sidelined by a knee injury, but it could carry implications for AFC playoff positioning. There's a lot of football left, but if the Ravens want to position themselves for home playoff games -- and they took a big step in that direction with the win at Seattle -- then they will be pulling for the Packers here.

Instead, they're keen on letting their play do the talking.





""I think the one thing that's good about our team is we read the press clippings and see everything, but we don't care. We've got bunch of people and a bunch of guys who don't care what you write about them,"" Judon said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 23. ""We don't care what happened the last game, we don't care how the loss was. We just want to get back to work and we want to get that going.""





One of the keys to the Ravens' success this year has been quarterback Lamar Jackson. This season, Jackson is completing 63.3 percent of his passes and has thrown for 1,650 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. He has also rushed for 576 yards (an average of 6.9 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. Combined, that's 2,226 total yards -- more yards than 14 other NFL teams have posted thus far.





Judon believes Jackson is truly unique and really enjoys watching him excel on the field.





""I don't think anybody can do what he is doing right now,"" Judon said. ""He is definitely a generational player and one that I'm glad I get to watch.""





This past offseason, the Ravens suffered major blows to last year's No. 1-ranked defense, including the loss of linebackers Terrell Suggs (Arizona Cardinals) and Za'Darius Smith (Green Bay Packers) to free agency. However, Judon, who has four sacks this year, is all in on his bigger role and the responsibilities that have come with it.





""I'm somebody that loves football, I'm somebody that just really enjoys the game and everything it comes with, so I knew that going ahead that I was going to get my reps with the departure of Sizz and Za'Darius and I welcomed that,"" Judon said. ""It doesn't matter to me if you need me to play the nose guard. I don't know if my weight would be equipped to do it, but ... let's see what happens.""





Even though the Ravens are standing tall at 5-2, one of the major stories this season has been injuries.





The Ravens lost nickel back Tavon Young (neck), safety Tony Jefferson (knee) and linebacker Pernell McPhee (triceps) for the season, while cornerback Jimmy Smith (knee) and wide receiver Marquise ""Hollywood"" Brown (ankle) are still on the mend, so not everything has gone the Ravens' way this season.





Thus far, the Ravens have overcome the injuries. Due to McPhee's triceps injury, rookie Jaylon Ferguson and second-year player Tyus Bowser are the next men up. Judon believes they are up for the challenge.





""[Ferguson and Bowser are] a part of this 5-2 record as much as I am, as much as Lamar is, as much as Mark Ingram is,"" Judon said. ""They've been here with us this whole time, it's not like they are newly acquired players. They've been here the whole time, and they're ready. Me and Jaylon talk often. It's his rookie year, which is probably the hardest year in the league and we talk often. He's in a good mental state, whatever we need him to do, he's gonna be able to do it.""





The Ravens' 30-16 victory in Seattle Oct. 20 certainly gave the Ravens a major boost going into the bye week, and Judon is more than ready for the week off. He's enjoying his bye week in New York with his daughter.





""This is a reload session,"" Judon said. ""We had seven hard games and we got the back half of our season left and we got some tough teams, especially with the Patriots coming up, so this just a reload session.""

Harris, a Buffalo native and 2018 undrafted free agent out of Buffalo, spent parts of the last two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and this story begins across the pond in London after the Bucs' 37-26 loss to the Carolina Panthers Oct. 13.





After traveling back to Tampa, Harris flew back home to Buffalo with plans of proposing to his girlfriend Friday, Oct. 18, but on Tuesday, Oct. 15, he received news that Tampa Bay was releasing him.





""Whenever adversity hits like that, to that extent, it always means something better is about to happen,"" Harris said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 24.





Almost immediately, the Ravens called him up, asking him to fly out to Baltimore for a workout Wednesday, Oct. 16. Suffering from jet lag, Harris worked out with the Ravens, but by the time he went back to the airport, the ring had gone missing, forcing him to go back to the hotel to look for it.





""I didn't panic at all. Anybody that knows me personally knows I'm not gonna panic,"" Harris said. ""I focus more on the solution than the problem. When I lost the ring, the first thing I did was call my jeweler and get a temporary ring made.""





Harris still needed to get back to Tampa to return his playbook to the Buccaneers, so he flew back to Florida. On his way back, the Ravens called, saying they would sign him Monday, Oct. 21, and the team hotel called, saying the ring was found.





""It made for a hell of a story. I can't make that up. It really happened,"" Harris said. ""I lived through it. All my close family members were more stressed than I was and I'm just like, 'Everyone, relax.'""









BLESS UP ���� #106D pic.twitter.com/8kM61heqFG



— Mone Harris (@DemoneHarris) October 23, 2019 Long story short, the ring was sent to him, he was able to propose on time and he found a new home in the Ravens. Harris found the woman who found the ring and gave her $1,000 worth of Visa gift cards as a debt of gratitude.



He posted his story on Twitter ( He posted his story on Twitter ( here and here ) and it went viral, as news outlets picked up and shared his story to a larger audience.





""My intention of the story was to try to strengthen someone's faith because someone might be going through adversity,"" Harris said. ""Wednesday when it didn't look so good, I could've folded, but I kept my composure and kept praying and God came back and blessed me in a matter of hours with both things.""





Once he got back to Buffalo to propose to his now fiancee, Arianna Marinelli, it was a relief for him after a week of arguably the craziest events of his life. However, when he told her about the news, her reaction wasn't what you would expect.





""She was more amazed when I told her the story and how I kept my composure and didn't even tell her that I lost it,"" Harris said. ""I talk to her every day, all the time. She was more astonished that I didn't even flinch.""





While being signed onto the practice squad, the 6-foot-4, 272-pound Harris knows this is a new opportunity for him to make noise with another team.





It also completed the story. The Ravens not only helped him find the engagement ring, but they signed him to the team.





""I'm forever indebted to them because obviously, that's a big step in life,"" Harris said. ""Regardless of what happens, I'll always remember the franchise for that.""





Harris' story will live on, but now, he's got football to focus on, and a great opportunity lies ahead of him in Baltimore. His signing coincided with the season-ending injury to Pernell McPhee (triceps), another blow to the Ravens' defense.





The team has dealt with injuries well so far this season, but McPhee's departure from the team opens up a spot that Harris is eyeing to get.





""I jumped at the opportunity to come here because I felt that I might have that opportunity,"" Harris said. ""I'm just gonna keep working. My biggest goal this week after being in the Ravens' training facility the past two days is getting the playbook for the bye week. I can just take the rest of the week and study the playbook.""

2019-10-25,"['season', 'deadline', 'ravens', 'defensive', 'breer', 'trade', 'teams', 'oct', 'nfl', 'need', 'rush', 'possibilities', 'bowl', 'win', 'farrar', 'doug', 'pass']",redskins,"After a convincing 30-16 win against the Seattle Seahawks Oct. 20, the Baltimore Ravens are now 5-2 headed into the bye week with the New England Patriots coming to town for ""Sunday Night Football"" Nov. 3.







With less than a week left until the NFL's trade deadline Oct. 29, the action may not be done for the Ravens, who have been quite active so far.





They traded for Los Angeles Rams Pro Bowl cornerback Marcus Peters, who had an immediate impact in the win against the Seahawks, returning an interception for a touchdown in the second quarter to put the Ravens up, 13-10.









Peters helped patch up a secondary that had been depleted the last few weeks, but there are other spots the team is looking at, including the pass rush. However, the market isn't expansive.





""If you need receivers or if you need corners, you can find guys out there,"" The MMQB's Albert Breer said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 22. ""It's a lot hard to find offensive and defensive linemen right now. Those positions really are at a premium in the NFL.""





One of the biggest reasons for this increased need for pass rushers is the loss of linebacker Pernell McPhee for the rest of the 2019 season with a torn triceps, suffered during the win in Seattle. McPhee was second on the team in sacks this season (three) before suffering the injury, a big blow to an already shaken up Ravens defense.





USA Today Media Group's Doug Farrar said on ""That McPhee thing is a big problem,""Media Group's Doug Farrar said on Glenn Clark Radio Oct. 21.





Though teams won't necessarily be willing to give up top-tier talent, there are some different avenues the Ravens could explore ahead of the Oct. 29 deadline.





""It could be an interior guy. It doesn't necessarily have to be an edge player,"" Farrar said. ""They love to blitz. They're very creative with it.""





Farrar discussed the idea of looking for second-tier players with potential because the best teams have great rosters top to bottom, including those relatively unknown players who are put in the best spots to succeed.





""[Don] Martindale is one of the top defensive coordinators. They have a great staff,"" Farrar said. ""Their staff is in alignment with the front office, so even if they make a couple of moves that don't really pin the needle, it could really show up in January.""





Overall, a few names were thrown out by Breer: Denver Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller, Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Geno Atkins and defensive end Carlos Dunlap and Atlanta Falcons defensive end Vic Beasley.





Beasley's name was discussed further, but his value is in question due to his underwhelming performance since his career year in 2016. Beasley, drafted eighth overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Clemson, has 31 career sacks, half of those (15.5) coming in his Pro Bowl and first-team All-Pro 2016 season.





However, the 6-foot-3, 246-pound Beasley has just 1.5 sacks this season and is making $12.81 million on his fifth-year rookie option. He is a free agent after the season.





""He's expensive and he hasn't played very well or anywhere close to expectations over the first five years of his career,"" Breer said.





With the Ravens' hot start, fans and media are looking toward the playoffs. A 2.5 game lead over the Browns and Steelers in the AFC North helps to fuel that, as does the play of quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is putting up historic numbers in his first full season under center.





If the Ravens want to make a deep playoff run to challenge the New England Patriots for AFC supremacy and a spot in the Super Bowl, they need to make moves on the defense, according to Farrar.





""They have a couple guys who are sort of sneaky when it comes to creating pressure, but I think, especially in the playoffs, you're going to need more,"" Farrar said.





Even with a high-powered offense, the best teams are multi-faceted and can pounce on both sides of the ball. The team's activity ahead of the deadline will help determine just how good the Ravens' defense can be.





""This is the kind of offense that can get you to the Super Bowl,"" Farrar said. ""Their defense is going to have to carry them there, too, and I don't think they're that far away.""

They’re 5-2 and hold a comfortable lead over the rest of the AFC North. While they’ve been far from perfect, they remain one of the best teams in the league and have seen major strides on both sides of the football.

But when you look back at the Ravens’ offseason, there are a few things they could have done differently to put themselves in an even better position. With that in mind, I broke down four moves Baltimore should have made — or in one case, not made:

Keeping either Za’Darius Smith or Terrell Suggs

The Ravens let both of their starting outside linebackers leave in free agency. With the tiniest amount of hindsight, that was a really bad move. Granted, keeping Smith would have meant paying him like he got paid in Green Bay, which Baltimore couldn’t really afford without some creative math and probably at the loss of another free agent signing.

But Smith’s six sacks through seven games would have dramatically helped a Ravens defense that has struggled to bring quarterbacks down this season.

If Baltimore couldn’t have afforded Smith, Suggs is the guy they should have focused on. Owner Steve Bisciotti admitted the team was hoping Suggs would take less money to stay. Given how little the sides were likely off and how much they needed his production, it seems foolish to let Suggs leave.

Much like Smith, Suggs’ five sacks through seven games would be a huge boost to the Ravens defense. That’s one more than Judon has through the same number of games and is equal to what Tyus Bowser, Patrick Onwuasor, Brandon Carr and L.J. Fort have combined for.

The best part of keeping either Smith or Suggs would’ve been the impact on the other pass rushers on Baltimore’s roster. Judon would receive far less attention, which would likely boost his sack total.",4 moves Ravens should have made in 2019 offseason,https://ravenswire.usatoday.com/2019/10/25/4-moves-the-ravens-should-have-made-this-offseason/

While winning is great and has Baltimore sitting at the top of the AFC North, it does affect their position in the 2020 NFL draft order.

According to FTW, the Ravens sit at No. 25 after seven weeks of play. Baltimore is in a three-way tie at 5-2, but are right around the cutoff point for the wild card / divisional playoff that push them into the next tier regardless of their record. With the Ravens currently holding a nice lead over the rest of the teams in the AFC North, that seems like a safe bet to have them miss out on the wild card round entirely.

There’s plenty of season left and with Baltimore on their bye this week, they’ll likely shift around a little more almost immediately. But with how well they’re playing, a mid-20s draft pick seems to be in order, barring a second-half collapse.

If the draft order holds true, the Ravens will have the No. 25 pick three seasons in a row. They traded down to select tight end Hayden Hurst in 2018 and stayed at No. 25 to select wide receiver Marquise Brown in 2019. Selecting in the mid-20s has been kind to Baltimore, grabbing greats like safety Ed Reed (24th in 2002) and linebacker Ray Lewis (26th in 1996).

Thanks to a hefty lead, Baltimore isn’t in danger of losing their top-place spot but could come away even bigger winners without playing a single snap.

The Ravens are looking to get healthier this week. With injuries to cornerbacks Jimmy Smith and Maurice Canady, wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor causing each player to miss games, getting some time to recuperate should see them all return for Week 9 for the second half of the season.

But Baltimore is the only team in the AFC North not playing in Week 8. With some interesting matchups this weekend, Ravens fans can still root for football, albeit against a few of Baltimore’s division rivals. Losses would continue to push the Ravens up the AFC North standings.

Let’s take a look at Week 8’s matchups

Baltimore Ravens (5-2) – Bye week

Cincinnati Bengals (0-7) at Los Angeles Rams (4-3)

There’s a serious case for Cincinnati being the worst team in football right now. They’re so bad, analysts keep talking about them potentially trading away their best player in wide receiver A.J. Green just so he can have a shot at winning elsewhere and they can fully dive into the rebuild they so desperately need. They might not be as committed to losing as the Dolphins but the Bengals might be on a better path to an 0-16 season.

Los Angeles has lost a little of its luster. They started off strong, winning three straight games before dropping three in a row. After beating up on the pathetic Atlanta Falcons, they get another easy matchup that should turn into an absolute drubbing on the stat sheet.

Here are seven under-the-radar names who have been vital to the team’s success.

Chuck Clark, S

Clark seamlessly moved into the starting lineup in Week 5 after Jefferson’s injury and the third-year player was well-prepared. He wears the “green dot” communication helmet, relaying defensive signals from Defensive Coordinator Wink Martindale to the entire unit. Clark has proven he can handle that extra responsibility. The Ravens had some miscommunications in the secondary early in the season, but those issues have disappeared during their current three-game winning streak.

“I don’t care what you throw at him, he knows exactly what to do and he’s going to be able to line everybody up on the defense,” Defensive Backs Coach Chris Hewitt said. “He doesn’t just know his job. He knows everybody else’s job. He’s just cool. He’s not going to get too high, he’s never going to get too low. He handles all the ups and downs throughout the game. He never wavers and he’s a really good football player.”

Nick Boyle, TE

Boyle’s route running has improved this season (12 catches, 145 yards) but blocking remains his specialty. Baltimore has the NFL’s top-ranked rushing attack and Boyle is a key part of the equation. As Offensive Line Coach Joe D’Alessandris said, “I kid him all the time; he’s a glorified guard just playing tight end.”

Boyle has 87 catches during his five-year career, but he’s still looking for his first career touchdown. He’s had plenty of time to think about a touchdown celebration, but in the meantime, he continues to excel doing the dirty work in the trenches. Defensive Line Coach Joe Cullen calls Boyle a throwback.

“Nick is as good as they get in terms of blocking, and he's athletic enough to go out and catch passes,” Cullen said. “Usually, you don't have that luxury. When I first came into the league in 2006, every team had a Nick Boyle. It just seems like they're a rare breed now.”

Bradley Bozeman, LG

Remember when left guard was the biggest question mark on the offensive line entering the season? A sixth-round pick in 2018, Bozeman has started every game and has solidified the position, holding his own against top defensive linemen like Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, Cameron Heyward of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jarran Reed of the Seattle Seahawks. When he has made a mistake, Bozeman has shaken it off quickly.

“He’s had the top inside people and has done one heck of a job,” D’Alessandris said. “I’ve seen nothing but good growth. He’s improved as a puller. He’s improved as a good pass protector. We all make mistakes – coaches, players. We all have a little flaw here or there. The object is to correct it, and he’s correctable, and he works hard at it. He’s doing one hell of a job.”

Josh Bynes, ILB

The Ravens haven’t lost a game since Bynes signed as a free agent and went from the street to the starting lineup prior to Week 5. What Bynes did against the Steelers, starting at middle linebacker after just three practices, isn’t nearly as easy as he made it look. He had a season-high eight tackles Sunday against Seattle and seems to be gaining more comfort with Baltimore’s system.

Bynes diagnoses plays quickly and is a sure tackler. He brought exactly what the Ravens’ defense needed after giving up 500 yards in back-to-back games. His acquisition allowed Patrick Onwuasor to return to his best position, weakside linebacker. With Onwuasor expected to return from an ankle injury following the bye, Baltimore’s inside linebacker rotation has been stabilized.

Brandon Carr, CB

Carr’s durability is well known but his versatility is equally impressive. His streak of 183 consecutive starts is the longest among active defensive players. Carr has played outside corner, slot corner and safety at a high level, helping the Ravens adjust to losing slot cornerback Tavon Young and safety Tony Jefferson for the season, and losing cornerback Jimmy Smith for multiple games.

Where would the Ravens be without Carr? Hewitt isn’t eager to find out.

“Brandon is cool as a fan,” Hewitt said. “Anything that you throw at him – ‘Hey, Brandon, I need you to play safety.’ ‘Cool.’ ‘I need you to play nickel.’ ‘Cool.’ He can handle all of those positions. There’s not too much that he hasn’t seen and hasn’t been able to handle. Having Brandon Carr, that’s huge for us.”

L.J. Fort, ILB

Starting two games after Onwuasor was injured, Fort has played aggressively since being signed prior to Week 5. This is Fort’s fifth NFL team and his eighth season, but he had only started three games prior to this year. He’s making the most of his opportunity. Even if he doesn’t start after Onwuasor returns, Fort is expected to remain part of the linebacker rotation.

“A guy like L.J., he’s been in the league for quite a while now, and he’s finally getting a good shot to go out there and show what he can do,” Linebackers Coach Mike Macdonald said.

Matt Skura, C

Noisy road environments like Kansas City and Seattle have tested Skura, but he has not lost his composure.Even after committing pre-snap penalties, Skura never lets it carry over to the next play. Skura has started 23 straight games at center and at age 26, his best football should be ahead of him. He is currently graded as the sixth-best center in the league, per Pro Football Focus.",Some Ravens Difference-Makers Who Fly Under the Radar,https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/some-ravens-difference-makers-who-fly-under-the-radar

For 2020, Jackson is projected in the Tier 2/Tier 3 range.

Tier 2 is categorized as a QB who can “carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game.” Tier 3 QBs are “a legitimate starter but needs a stronger running game and/or defense to win. A lower-volume passing offense makes his job easier.”

“I would bump him up to a 3,” a personnel director told Sando. “Because they got a run game going and they are letting him play how he plays, it is very sustainable. That is who he is. In your tiers, it is a fallacy, in my opinion, to say in order for this guy to get moved up, he has to be a pocket passer. He’s not that, but guess what? He can sit back there as a quarterback and the threat that he poses running the ball and being efficient with his throws puts strain on defenses. I think that is enough for him to move up.”

An offensive assistant coach said of Jackson: “He knows how to work, he likes it, he’s not afraid, he galvanizes everybody. His energy rubs off on that offense, which was dead in the water before he got there. That is why they have gone through so many coordinators. Now, they have life. Now, they are the strength of the building, because of that kid.”

Mayfield was downgraded from a low Tier 2 to a low Tier 3.

“He would be the opposite of Lamar Jackson,” an evaluator said. “Instead of identifying what he needed to work on to keep progressing, Baker made commercials. … You know every player in the NFL sees it. You know it gets brought up. Has this guy done enough to be on every other commercial? Now you have defensive players rubbing his nose in it.”

On a side note, Jackson moved up to No. 3 in NFL.com’s quarterbacks index. He’s behind the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson and Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and tied with the Houston Texans’ Deshaun Watson.

“He landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it,” NFL.com’s Tom Blair wrote. “When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn't a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.”

Is Best Yet to Come for Ravens?

Now that we’ve taken a look back, let’s take a look ahead.

The Ravens are currently the No. 3 seed in the AFC, but their schedule gets significantly tougher in the second half of the season. Five of Baltimore’s next six games are against teams with winning records, including the league’s two undefeated teams – the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers.

The Ravens and Patriots apparently weren’t finished acquiring each other’s players this week.

According to a tweet from his agent, the Ravens signed linebacker Ufomba Kamalu off the Patriots practice squad.

Kamalu has been with the Patriots since last November, and was called up to the active roster for the last two games last year. Originally an undrafted free agent from Miami, he has also spent time with the Texans and Cardinals.

The Patriots and Ravens effectively swapped defensive backs earlier this week.

Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley has barely played this season, and it may be a long time before he plays again.

Mosley will miss Sunday’s game after aggravating the groin injury that already forced him to miss most of this season. And Jets coach Adam Gase said he couldn’t rule out putting Mosley on injured reserve.

That would be a major disappointment for a player who signed a five-year, $85 million contract in March. Mosley has only played in two games this season and hurt his groin in both of them.

It would also be bad news for the Ravens, who were expecting to get a third-round compensatory pick for Mosley. The NFL’s complex compensatory pick formula considers playing time for departing free agents in determining which teams are compensated, and if Mosley doesn’t play much this season for the Jets, the Ravens won’t get the pick they thought they’d get when he signed that big contract.","C.J.

Receiver Antonio Brown continues to wait for his next opportunity, and he continues to be justifiably frustrated by the fact that the NFL’s slow-moving investigation is essentially keeping Brown suspended without pay.

A day after Brown tweeted (and deleted) a suggestion that he’s being blackballed by the league and separately seemed to concede that he won’t play again until 2020, Brown embarked on an extended Twitter Q&A that was, to say the least, interesting.

He touched on various issues, from accusing Patriots trainers of stealing the football with which he scored his only touchdown with the team to expressing interest in playing for the Ravens to indicating that he wanted to play for the 49ers but that they weren’t interested to blaming the media for his current predicament to making it clear he has no interest in the XFL or CFL to repeatedly declining requests from radio stations to join their shows on Friday morning.

Brown also had this assessment regarding his parting message to Raiders fans: “Sorry it didn’t work bought crib out there was ready to go to work but I was to much steak for a chicken plan.”

The league still hasn’t scheduled an interview with Brown regarding the investigation sparked by a civil lawsuit for sexual assault and rape. Interested teams won’t sign him until the investigation concludes. His frustration is therefore understandable.

Whatever you think of Brown, he and all players have rights. Under the Personal Conduct Policy, however, there are no deadlines or mandates that would force things along and/or require the league to declare whether a player would be placed on paid leave if signed by a new team. As a result, he’ll have plenty of time to engage in plenty of tweetstorms, quite possibly for the balance of the 2019 season.",Frustrated Antonio Brown has active morning on Twitter,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/10/25/frustrated-antonio-brown-has-active-morning-on-twitter/

Seattle got a bit of a reality check last Sunday when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens, 30-16. Russell Wilson proved that he was human, throwing his first interception of the season to Marcus Peters, who returned it 67 yards for a score to give Baltimore 13-10 second-quarter lead. The Seahawks also didn’t have much of an answer for Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' running game, as they gave up 116 yards to Jackson on 14 carries. DK Metcalf’s fourth-quarter fumble resulted in a Marlon Humphrey 18-yard return for a touchdown that iced the game for Baltimore. Those two critical turnovers showed just how little of a margin for error there is in the NFL, especially for Seattle.

Atlanta has been in a free fall all season long with five straight losses after a 24-20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. The Falcons were overwhelmed by a desperate Los Angeles Rams team, 37-10 last Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Matt Ryan left the game with an ankle injury and is questionable for this week’s game. The lack of a running game cost Atlanta against Los Angeles too; they were only able to generate 38 yards on 15 carries. The frustration of a season getting away from them is another issue for the Falcons, as Devonta Freeman was ejected for punching Aaron Donald in the third quarter while trailing 20-3.

Three Things to Watch

1. Seahawks secondary

General manager John Schneider got active in the trade market on Tuesday when Seattle acquired safety Quandre Diggs from the Detroit Lions for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. Diggs was a Lions' team captain and has the capability to produce at a high level with three interceptions in 2017 and '18. This season has been a bit more of a struggle since Diggs has been battling a hamstring issue. Two things sparked this move by Schneider to go out and get some help for the defense. First, injuries to Bradley McDougald and Lano Hill created opportunities for rookie Marquise Blair, who got his first start last Sunday. Blair is a very physical player who should pair well with Diggs in the secondary and start to bring back more of an aggressive element to the Seahawks. The other reason was Tedric Thompson giving up a 50-yard completion over his head to Miles Boykin during the opening possession last week against Baltimore. Giving up a deep ball like that is the ultimate cardinal sin as a defensive back for coach Pete Carroll.

2. Seahawks' offensive balance and pass rush

The Seahawks have a great opportunity to get right this week when it comes to taking care of the fundamentals. First, the running game couldn’t get rolling last week against a fired-up Ravens defense. Chris Carson had 21 carries for 61 yards and wasn’t able to wear down Baltimore in the second half. Atlanta ranks 21st in rushing defense at 113.7 rushing yards allowed per game, so opportunities should be plentiful for Seattle offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer to establish the run. This will then set up Wilson to go to work throwing the football in play action to Tyler Lockett, Jaron Brown, and DK Metcalf. It will be important for the receivers to do a better job of creating separation, as Wilson had the throw ball away 12 times last week. Defensively, the Seahawks' inability to get sacks continues to be a problem; their 11 sacks on the year ranks just for 26th in the NFL. This week should be a great opportunity for their defensive line to generate more pressure since neither Ryan nor backup Matt Schaub will be very mobile. The lack of mobility of the Falcons quarterbacks should help Jadeveon Clowney and Ziggy Ansah get more opportunities for sacks this week.

3. Which Atlanta team is going to show up?

Head coach Dan Quinn is on the hot seat with the Falcons sitting at 1-6. The defense, Quinn's specialty, has struggled all year long, which adds fuel to the speculation that owner Arthur Blank will eventually move on from Quinn. The front office has started the fire sale this week by trading wide receiver Mohamed Sanu to the New England Patriots for a second-round draft pick. One has to wonder if the other players rumored to be on the trading block will mail it in or play out of their minds to encourage a trade. Hence, getting off to a fast start will be important for the Falcons if they are going to have a shot to pull off a huge upset. The nightmare scenario is falling behind 17-0, which would allow the Seahawks to tee off defensively and turn the crowd against them very quickly.

Final Analysis

If you are going to be a playoff team in the NFC, there is very little room to give away games when as the favorite. Seattle should be able to start fast and methodically pull away for a decisive win. Wilson will get back on track, throwing the football and connecting on about three explosive plays in the passing game to threaten 300 yards. The defense will do a solid job and create a couple of turnovers against whoever starts at quarterback this week. Bottom line, the Seahawks will have enough focus on the road in Atlanta to get the job done to set themselves up for another winnable game next week at home against Tampa Bay.

A Ravens season based on new directions is led by their dominant tackle

Up is down, night is day and cats are barking dogs up trees for the Baltimore Ravens these days.

The Ravens have long been an organization traditionally defined by a dominant defense holding up a lackluster offense, with Marshall Yanda being the top dog on the offensive line. But a look at this year’s squad reveals a team being largely driven by their electric play maker at quarterback.

While Yanda is still a top-shelf player at right guard, tackle Ronnie Stanley is becoming the dominant force on what has been a very effective line to this point of the season.It might be underselling Stanley’s performance to qualify him as the top-performer on the Ravens’ line.

In fact, we might be looking at the premier left tackle in football. Per Pro Football Focus, Stanley is currently grading out as that organization’s top pass-blocking tackle in the game.

Sure, PFF comes with its detractors, as does, well, anything in this current world of “hate-first-then-determine” culture we surround ourselves in, but it is not the only organization that sees Stanley’s performance as top-shelf. ESPN’s analytic staffers have developed what they call the “Pass Block Win Rate” to determine the performance of offensive lineman. Stanley graded out well there, also, registering a 93-percent efficiency rate.

Since being drafted by the Ravens with the sixth overall selection of the 2015 NFL Draft, Stanley has been a solid and dependable left tackle, a luxury that many teams in the league chase every year. Just take a look at the disaster that is currently the Cleveland Browns offensive line.

Then look again. Because it’s hilarious. Absolute comedy, from every angle. You can just picture Cleveland fans trying to shield their eyes from the atrocities that are happening at the line of scrimmage nearly every single pass play…

But I digress.

Stanley has continuously taken a step every season, and that dependable left tackle has now become a dominant one. As a young quarterback continues to develop, and new pieces will be introduced into the offensive line mix over the next few years, Stanley’s emergence as both a force and a leader of the position group becomes more and more critical.

The 2015 season for the Ravens was an unmitigated disaster, as injuries and losses resulted in a 5-11 campaign — a stinker by any measure. But out of that stink came a diamond. And he has been improving and excelling at his craft ever since.

For all the justifiable hype about Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews and Marquise “Hollywood” Brown, it’s time we shine a little light on the big man playing left tackle. Ronnie Stanley has earned it.",Ronnie Stanley has become top-shelf tackle for Baltimore Ravens,https://ebonybird.com/2019/10/25/ronnie-stanley-positioning-himself-as-top-shelf-tackle-for-the-baltimore-ravens/

Baltimore signed defensive back Jordan Richards Thursday afternoon after he was released by New England Wednesday. Earlier this week, Baltimore released veteran special teams ace Justin Bethel to save a likely fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. The Ravens didn’t want to let Bethel go, but they wanted that pick. The Patriots picked up Bethel, and released Jordan Richards to make room on the 53-man roster. Then the Ravens picked up the 26-year-old Richards, who was a second-round pick out of Stanford in 2015.

T-3. Lamar Jackson Let’s take a moment to appreciate all the possible fates Lamar Jackson dodged -- like so many desperate would-be tacklers on an 8-yard scoring run on fourth-and-2 -- in becoming the most successful quarterback of the 2018 class so far. He wasn’t drafted by a ramshackle team prone to talent-stifling organizational chaos, toxic infighting and disruptive turnover. He wasn’t forced on a coach who didn’t like him or understand how to use him. He wasn’t burdened with sky-high expectations before he’d ever taken an NFL snap. He wasn’t thrown on the field before he was ready. Instead, he landed on a competitive roster directed by a coaching staff and front office with the smarts to develop a plan for him and the temerity to stick to it. When you see Jackson demolishing opponents by air and by land, remember that this wasn’t a fluke or a mere stroke of good luck. Baltimore saw a quarterback where others refused to see one, and now its offense is run by a burgeoning MVP candidate with limitless potential.

2019-10-25,"['pro', 'play', 'seahawks', 'game', 'ravens', 'film', 'baltimore', 'yanda', 'nfl', 'mashal', 'shows', 'run', 'season']",redskins,"About 14 months ago, retirement was on the mind of Baltimore Ravens seven-time Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda.

Yanda broke his ankle in 2017 and also underwent a procedure on his shoulder, and as the ‘18 season began, the Ravens great said he figured he would end his career if another serious injury or two arrived. But it didn’t. He got through another Pro Bowl season and decided to return in 2019 — and the Ravens are ecstatic about that.

At 35, Yanda is the elder statesmen of a young and unique Baltimore offense. He’s one of its most important players, too, as a right guard with the ability to stand up against pass rushers, clobber defenders in the run game and set the tone for a unit led by quarterback Lamar Jackson.

Offensive line coach Joe D’Alessandris said he’s “always glad” Yanda didn’t retire before this season.

“Seven-time Pro Bowler, just his attitude and his energy,” D’Alessandris said. “You see it on Sundays, how he plays, right? Guess what? I see it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday at practice. The same guy. And I see it on Sunday. He displays — he is what he is. He is one hell of a football player.”

Yanda’s dependability and consistent performances provide value to the Ravens. But two plays from Sunday’s win over the Seahawks stood out as specific examples of the affect the veteran offensive guard has on his team, and they both came on during Baltimore’s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.

The first one came on an 8-yard carry for Mark Ingram and it showcased still-impressive set of skills Yanda carries in his 13th NFL season. Watch below. Yanda (No. 73), the only Ravens lineman pulling on the play, makes an athletic and clean move to get out of his stance and sprint to his left. That helps him get position to clear a path Ingram (21).

And just as Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright comes in to try and make a play, Yanda pancakes him with a punishing hit.

From NFL Game Pass

Later in the drive, the Ravens scored a touchdown on a fourth-and-2 from the Seahawks’ 8-yard line when Jackson ran to his left and darted through a hole.

On this play, Baltimore elected not to pull Yanda. Instead, the Ravens sent other lineman running in front of Jackson and asked their most accomplished offensive player to take on the task of blocking 330-pound nose tackle Al Woods.

Had Woods sliced into the backfield or found space to run to his left, perhaps he could’ve disrupted Jackson’s path. But look at how much push Woods is able to generate once Yanda locks in on him — none.

From NFL Game Pass

Yanda still has the athleticism and the strength to hold up against the NFL’s top defensive players and his dependability allows Baltimore to get creative with schemes for the league’s No. 1-ranked rushing offense. Judging by Yanda’s response to Jackson’s touchdown run, the decorated lineman still carries enthusiasm for the game, too.

The Ravens signed Yanda to a contract extension that runs through the 2020 season, but it’s unclear whether he’ll continue playing beyond this year.

What’s certain is that the 2019 Ravens feel fortunate he decided to stick around.
